# Top X most frequent words.
This project aims to identify the most common words in a large text file and to make a top out of the X amount of words desired by the user.
The program will ask the user to insert how big should the top be ("e.g. 10") and it will save in another file called "output.txt" a pandas Series with the list and also a jpg with the plot of these words.

- Matploitlib is used to plot the result in form of a bar plot.
- Pandas is used to acces the Series object in order to create a good looking list output.
